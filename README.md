# Simulating-LoRaWAN

This project is a system for generating and simulating data transmission via LoRa (Long Range communication) and visualizing the data on a React-based frontend.

Features

Data Generation: Simulates real-time sensor data.

LoRa Transmission Simulation: Emulates the process of sending data via LoRa.

React-based Visualization: Displays the transmitted data in an interactive and user-friendly plot.

Dynamic Updates: The frontend dynamically updates with incoming data.

Tech Stack

Backend: Python (Flask/FastAPI for API, or custom simulation scripts)

LoRa Communication: Simulated via Python

Frontend: React (with libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for visualization)

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites

Node.js & npm

Python (3.x)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Backend Setup:

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the backend:

python backend.py

Frontend Setup:

Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the React app:

npm start

Usage

Start the backend server to generate and simulate LoRa data transmission.

Open the frontend in your browser.

View real-time data plots updating as data is received.

Future Enhancements

Integrating real LoRa hardware

Adding authentication & user management

Enhancing visualization with 3D models
